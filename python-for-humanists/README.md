# Python for Humanists

The materials for this workshop are all located in the linked jupyter/IPython Notebook. 

If you already have jupyter notebooks installed, you can download the .ipynb files, run them locally, and follow along with the lesson. 

### Download Workshop Materials

Python for Huamanists is divided into three parts: Part I, II, and III. Each part has two .ipynb files: 
* Python4HumanistsPartx.ipynb *and* 
* PythonXComplete.ipynb

*Python4HumanistsPartx.ipynb* is intended to be used during the workshop as we code together and fill in the code cells. 

*PythonXComplete.ipynb* is the completed workshop with all code and exercises completed. This is intended as a reference or answer key for the workshop.

**If you don't have python or jupyter notebooks installed, we recommend installing Anaconda 3 using the steps below.**

### Getting Started with Anaconda/Jupyter notebooks

First, let's [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Once Anaconda is installed, openm the Anaconda Navigator and 'Launch' jupyter from the menu.

### Running the Workshop Notebook

With jupyter open, navigate to the directory where you've downloaded the .ipynb files. Open the notebook and follow along with the lesson.
