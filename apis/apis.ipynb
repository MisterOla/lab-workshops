    "# Getting Started with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs make it easy to collect clean data for text mining and machine learning projects. In this workshop, we'll learn how to collect data from APIs, query APIs to filter the data we fetch, and process the data that APIs return to extract information of interest. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every API is an interface to a database. When we interact with the API, we fetch data from the database. This series of relationships could be visualized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style='text-align: center'><img src='./assets/api-schematic.png'><a href='https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-restful-api-with-rails-4b98dc76bf9c'>Image by Hector Polanco</a></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As this illustration indicates, a user tells an API what kind of data they would like, then the API fetches that data from a database and sends it to the user. Let's see this in action in our first example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving Crossword Puzzles with the DataMuse API\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, let's consider the DataMuse API. This API allows us to interact with a database that contains information about words. Using the DataMuse API, we can find words with certain constraints. Suppose for example we are completing the puzzle below and wish to find words that would fit into <i>2 Down</i>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style='text-align: center'>\n",
    "    <img style='width:140px;margin: 20px auto;' src='./assets/crossword-puzzle.png'>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for <i>2 Down</i>, we need some four-letter words that begin with S and end with D. We can get a list of such words by querying the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a target='_blank' href='https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=s??d' style='text-align: center; margin: 10px auto; display: block'>\n",
    "https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=s??d\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This URL pattern and all other supported URL patterns one can use to query this database are listed in [the DataMuse API documentation](https://www.datamuse.com/api/):\n",
    "\n",
    "<table class='text'>\n",
    "  <thead>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "      <th style='text-align: left' style='text-align: left'>In order to find...</th>\n",
    "      <th style='text-align: left'>Use <a href='https://api.datamuse.com'>https://api.datamuse.com</a> + ...</th>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "  </thead>\n",
    "  <tbody>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "      <td style='text-align: left'>words that start with <i>t</i>, end in <i>k</i>, and have two letters in between</td>\n",
    "      <td style='text-align: left'><a href=\"https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=t??k\" class=\"apilink\">/words?sp=t??k</a></td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",

    "    </tr>\n",
    "  </tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's spend a minute analyzing these urls. As we can see, all of the queries we can perform begin with \"https://api.datamuse.com\". We are then instructed to add \"/words?\" followed by a pattern specific to the kind of data we wish to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "For four letter words that begin with <i>t</i> and end with <i>k</i>, use https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=t??k  \n",
    "For words that rhyme with <i>forgetful</i>, use https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=forgetful \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examining API Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now examine the data the API returns. If you visit <a href='https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=s??d' target='_blank'>https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=s??d</a> in a web browser, you will see something similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href='https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=s??d' target='_blank'>\n",
    "    <img src='./assets/s--d.png'>\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This output is an example of JSON, a popular data format often used by APIs. To make that JSON data easier to analyze, let's paste it into a \"JSON prettifier\", such as <a href='https://www.jsonformatter.io/' target='_blank'>https://www.jsonformatter.io/</a>. If you do so, you should see something similar to the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "<a href='https://www.jsonformatter.io/' target='_blank' style='margin:10px 0; display: block'>\n",
    "    <img src='./assets/pretty-json.png'>\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on the right is identical to the data on the left, except the data on the right is formatted (or \"prettified\") to be a little easier to read. Looking at that right hand column, we see a few types of data that we will need to understand in order to be able to work with this API.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Square Braces = List\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can see that the JSON data begins (and eventually ends) with \"<b>square braces</b>\": [ ]. In JSON, square braces denote a <b>list</b>. In the case of the DataMuse API, each item in the list contains information about a word that meets the constraints specified in the URL we requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Squiggly Braces = Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can see that each of the words in our list is wrapped with \"<b>squiggly braces</b>\": { }. In JSON, squiggly brace denote a <b>dictionary</b> (which are also sometimes referred to as an \"object\"). Dictionaries are in turn comprised of two kinds of things: <b>keys</b> (on the left of a colon) and <b>values</b> (on the right of a colon):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/key-value.png' style='height:80px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary above contains two key value pairs. The first has the key \"word\" and the value \"shed\". The second has the key \"score\" and the value 3010. We say that each of these values is \"assigned\" to the key it belongs to. So the value assigned to \"word\" is \"shed\", and the value assigned to \"score\" is 3010.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quotation Marks = String\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the keys and the value \"shed\" above, we see that each is wrapped with \"<b>quotation marks</b>\": \" \". In JSON, quotation marks denote a <b>string</b> (a fancy word for \"text data\"). When viewing our JSON data using https://www.jsonformatter.io/, we can see that strings that are values inside a dictionary are colored red, but other text editors may not color code strings at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Whole Numbers = Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, whole numbers such as the number 3010 (colored teal above) are called \"<b>integers</b>\" in JSON. Integers should not be confused with numbers that contain decimals, which are instead called \"<b>floats</b>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing JSON Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To review what we've learned about JSON so far, see if you can answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the crossword puzzle we examined earlier. What URL would you use if you wanted to find words that could fit in <i>4 Down</i> below?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style='text-align: center'>\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Consider the dictionary below. How many key value pairs are there in this dictionary? What are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"word\": \"send\",\n",
    "    \"score\": 1718\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<details style='margin: 10px 25px'>\n",
    "  <summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "  There are 2 key value pairs. The first has the key \"word\" and the value \"send\". The second has the key \"score\" and the value 1718.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the data types of the elements in the following dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Allen Ginsberg\",\n",
    "    \"age\": \"28\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<details style='margin: 10px 25px'>\n",
    "  <summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "  The keys in this dictionary are strings. The value assigned to the \"name\" key is also a string, while the value assigned to the \"age\" key is an integer.\n",
    "</details>\n",
