# Neural Style Transfer

Neural style transfer is an algorithmic technique for taking the "style" of one digital image and applying it to the "content" of another. In this workshop, we will focus on the use of neural style transfer in creative art practice by generating images in [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/), out-of-the-box software that lets you apply style transfer techniques to your own images.

This workshop is designed for participants who are new to neural style transfer. No computer programming experience is required.

## Art & AI

### Key Terminology:
- **artificial intelligence** - used to describe computer programs that mimic human decision-making to perform tasks, where the computer develops or is given a set of rules to follow that it then draws on to help it evaluate scenarios
- **machine learning** - a subset of AI where the computer "learns" and adapts based on new information without human intervention after the initial training
- **deep learning** - a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural network algorithms that enable the computer to recognize patterns and classify data on its own

AI receives a lot of attention for its use in industry (self-driving cars) and surveillance (face detection), but it's also providing new ways for interacting with and thinking about texts and images.

### Popular Approaches

#### Generative Adversarial Networks

["Is Artificial Intelligence Set to Become Art's Next Medium?"](https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx) In October 2018, Christie's became the first auction house to sell art that was created by a generative adversarial network (GAN). GANs have two parts to them: a generator, which tries to create images that resemble its training set, and a discriminator, which tries to identify the fake, generated images from the real ones.

#### Combinations of Machine Learning Algorithms

["The Next Rembrandt: Can the Great Master Be Brought Back to Create One More Painting?"](https://www.nextrembrandt.com/) The project studied recurring features across 346 Rembrandt paintings so that their generated image would most closely resemble his subject matter and style. They used a range of techniques, from scanning the surface of his paintings to study their texture to programming a facial detection algorithm to identify geometric patterns.

#### Neural Style Transfer

One of the advantages of neural style transfer is that it does not require a large collection of images. At a minimum, it only requires two.

Questions we might ask with neural style transfer include but are by no means limited to:

* What can the approach tell us about what "content" and "style" mean to humans? To computers? 
* What images work better as content or style images, and what does it mean that some work better than others?
* Can we use neural style transfer to create new forms? What about new art that combines the styles of multiple artists?

## Setting up your Workspace 

For this workshop, we'll experiment with several style transfer models using sample images. But first, we need to set up our workspace.

### Folder & Filename Conventions

In order to keep track of our experiments (what images we used, what parameters we ran), let's establish a system for storing and naming our image files.

1. Create a new folder called "neural-style-experiments "on your Desktop (or somewhere you can access easily).

2. Inside that folder, create the following three folders:
* "content" - this will store the images we'll use as content images
* "style" - this will store the images we'll use as style images
* "output" - this will include the results of our experiments. 

3. Within "output," create the following folders:
* "adaptive-style-transfer"

Before we start running our experiments, we should also think about how we'll name our files. The convention I follow is:  
```
contentImageName-styleImageName-parameters.jpg
```
You may adopt this convention or devise one that feels more intuitive for you. Whatever you do, just do it consistently.

This folder & file structure will help us remember what we were working on, even if we return to the project months or years later.

*For extra insurance, we should also create a documentation.txt or readme.txt file that keeps track of each experiment*

### Images

For images, we'll be using a variety of images, some of which have more pronounced "styles" or "content," and some of which might be more subtle. I have also added relatively small images (400 x 400 pixels), so that the new image will generate quickly. High-resolution items can a longer time for the model to run, and you don't necessarily need high-resolution images in order for the model to be successful; it depends on your goal. 

To get a sense for the impact the size of the input content image can have, here are two output files. The larger image had an input image of around 1000 pixels, while the smaller image had an input of around 500 pixels. Some detail is lost as a result of cutting the resolution of the input image in half, but depending on the level of fidelity or abstraction that you're going for, that might be ok.

## Generating Images with RunwayML

Designated "a machine learning tool for creators," RunwayML is a platform for applying machine learning to digital content that does not require any programming on the part of the user. You could also use it to train and publish your own models.
 
To launch the application:
1. Download [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) by clicking on the green "Download Beta button."
2. Once it downloads, double-click on the RunwayML icon.
3. The screen that loads will have the following prompts: "Browse Models," "Open Workspaces," "Train a Model." Click on "Browse Models."
* Models are the result of training an algorithm on a dataset â€” they represent the rules the algorithm has devised in order to perform a task
* From the "Browse Models" screen, you can find models that were trained on images, texts, or vectors in order to perform object detection, generate fake images, explore latent space of images, and apply style transfer.
* If you accidentally (or intentionally) click away from the Models screen and want to get back, click on the cube symbol on the left-hand side of the application
4. Click the dropbox by "Category" and select "Style Transfer." 
* At the time of this workshop, there are five models. The lower left-hand corner of each model shows that four of the models have been published with "Commercial Use" licenses, while one has a "Custom License."
* The lower right-hand corner reveals their popularity within RunwayML, which could be used to indicate how well they're performing for people (the caveat, here, is that some of the models are newer than others, so a lower score isn't always an indication that a model is out of favor).

### Experiment 1: Adaptive Style Transfer, Limited Selection of Styles

We're going to start with the most popular one, "Adaptive-Style-Transfer." 

1. Let's start by taking a quick look at the model's documentation. Find the model, hover over the lower left-hand corner, and select "learn more." 
* This will take us to a page with important information about the model that we may want to read before running anything: what is the model trained to do, are there licensing restrictions to how the model can be used, is there a GitHub repository we could go to in order to see the code, has there been a publication using the code that we could read, and if the information is really good, it will also indicate what the training dataset was.
* Without getting in the weeds technically, we can see that this model was constructed with a conscious effort to add artists into the evaluation loop.
* Scrolling down shows us the authors and there's a paper and GitHub repository we could follow up with if we like the results
* Back at the top, click on "Gallery" for a preview of the results we can expect
* Click on "License" to see the terms of use. With this model, it can be used commercially so long as attribution is given.
2. Now that we have more of a sense for this model, click the dropdown blue "Add To Workspace" button at the top right of the application, and select "New Workspace."
3. Give the workspace a name that will help you identify it later. I'll call mine: "DHLab-workshop."
4. Now that we're in the workspace screen, we can see the interface for the model we've loaded, and on the left-hand column, we'll see past workspaces (once we have some).
5. The Adaptive Style Transfer model contains a place for an "Input Type" (this will be where we upload a content image) and an "Output" (the results of applying the model to our input image). The style options exist on the right-hand column. Unlike other models we'll experiment with later that will let us chose our own style images, we're limited to selecting amongst thirteen artists. But, the innovation that they're claiming, is that each artist represents a model that has been trained on a collection of paintings from that artist, whereas some other popular models only train them on a single painting. They're also regularly adding new artists to the list, so this could be a model to keep an eye on. If we scroll below the style options, we can see what parameters we can control as well to adjust how the algorithm is working. More on those later.
6. Select the style you would like to try first. I'm going to select "Monet."
7. To add a content image, click the dropdown by "Input Type" and select "File" -> "Directory." Navigate to our project folder and select the "content" directory. This will load our content images into RunwayML so that we can move between them quickly.
8. Select "goldenGateBridge.jpg."
9. Click the purple "Run Remotely" button in the lower right-hand corner in order to run the model. 
10. If you want to save this image, click the small blue circle in the lower right-hand corner of the "Output" screen. Don't forget to follow our naming convention: "goldenGateBridge-monet.jpg"
11. For a second image for a frame of reference, let's see how the model does with Van Gogh (you have to scroll all the way down the artist styles to find him). Apply this model to the Golden Gate Bridge as well, and save the output when it finishes. 

### Experiment 2: AdaIN Style Transfer, Custom Styles
1. Return to the "Browse Models" screen by clicking on the cube symbol on the left-hand column.
2. Click the dropdown by "Category" and select "Style Transfer."
3. This time, find "AdaIN-Style-Transfer" and click to "learn more." The advantage of this model is that we'll be able to add our own style images, along with our own content images. We'll also have the option to adjust more of the parameters that inform how the model works.
4. Click the "Add to Workspace" blue button. In general, you can either add it to the workspace we've already created, or you can create a new one, but for this workshop, add it to the same workspace (we'll need our models together for one of the activities later on).
5. In order to compare this model with the last one, let's stick with the Golden Gate Bridge for now. Add it as our content image by clicking the dropdown and selecting "File."
6. We have the freedom to add out own style image now, but we're limited to one style image at a time (the previous model was trained on multiple paintings by the same artist). So that we can have a more accurate comparison across the models, chose Claude Monet's *Water Lilies*.
7. Click "Run Remotely." This model can take longer to run, especially with larger files. Let's talk through some of the parameters options while it's working.
* Alpha affects how much of the style is pulled in, with a value of 1 leading to the strongest stylistic resemblance to the style image
* Gaussian Blur does what it sounds like - it blurs the content image before applying the model. This is helpful if you want a more abstract output.
8. Experiment on your own for a few minutes, changing the parameters on the right. One of my favorite tweaks was to adjust the Alpha to 0.79 and the Gaussian Blur to 7.
9. Save any and all outputs that you like. Don't forget to follow the naming convention so that you can recreate them later! For example, here is the filename for the settings I liked above:
```
goldenGateBridge-waterLilies-alphap79_gb7.png
```

### Experiment 3: Adaptive & AdaIN, Output as New Input
1. Staying within the AdaIn Style Transfer model, let's add a new content image. Click the dropdown and this time, let's select the output image from our Adaptive-Style-Transfer experiment.
2. For the style image, Yayoi Kusama's *Resplendent Stars of the Universe*.
3. Save the output file â€” be sure to include some indication that we used the output from the Adaptive Style Transfer model:
```
ast_golden_monet-resplendent
```

## Run your own Experiments

Now that we've sampled a couple models for style transfer, return to the one that intrigued you the most and run more experiments with your own images or with some of the additional sample images in our content and style folders. You might also run some of the other models we haven't tried in order to see their strengths and limitations.

## Next Steps & Additional Tips
* Since Runway is currently in Beta, new models and workflow features are added and updated regularly, so check back occasionally to see what's new.
* Try running [Justin Johnson's implementation](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style) of style transfer. This will require some experience with programming and setting up computer environments. It also has hardware constraints in that it performs better with a graphical processing unit (GPU). But, what it gives you is the ability to import multiple style images at the same time, in addition to more fine-tuned parameters that you can adjust.
